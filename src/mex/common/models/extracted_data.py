        """Ensure identifiers and provenance attributes are set for this instance.

        All extracted data classes have four important identifiers that are defined
        by `BaseEntity`, `ExtractedData` and the concrete classes themselves.

        - identifierInPrimarySource
        - hadPrimarySource
        - identifier
        - stableTargetId

        Every time we create a new instance of an extracted item, we automatically
        validate that these identifiers are set correctly.

        We check that `identifierInPrimarySource` and `hadPrimarySource` are provided,
        because otherwise we cannot reliably determine the origin of this item.
        These two identifiers are the only two that need to be set during extraction.

        Next, we query the configured `IdentityProvider` to determine whether this item
        already has an `identifier` and `stableTargetId`. If not, we let the identity
        provider generate new identifiers.

        If an `identifier` has been passed to the constructor, we check that it matches
        with what we got from the identity provider, because we don't allow any system
        to change the association from `identifierInPrimarySource` and
        `hadPrimarySource` to the `identifier`.
        A use-case for passing a matching `identifier` to the constructor would be
        parsing an already extracted item from an NDJSON file or an API endpoint.

        If a `stableTargetId` has been passed to the constructor, we use that as the
        new value, because changes to the stable target ID are generally allowed.
        A use-case for changing the `stableTargetId` will be the matching of
        multiple extracted items (see `BaseEntity.stableTargetId` for details).

            values: Raw values to validate

        Raises:
            ValueError: If `identifier` was supplied but does not match the id provider
            ValueError: If `identifierInPrimarySource` was missing
            ValueError: If `hadPrimarySource` was missing
