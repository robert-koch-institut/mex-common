Helper extractor to get metadata primary sources. It represents the original source of metadata that all the data in MEx will attach to. For example `confluence-vvt` primary source means: data extracted from `confluence-vvt` x-system will be attached to this primary source.

## Common use cases

- extract info of a particular primary source to attach extracted metadata to

## Configuration

To configure primary_source extractor, set `primary_sources_path` in settings to point to `primary-sources.json` in `mex-assets` repository. A sample primary sources file is also included in `mex-extractors` at `assets/raw-data/primary-sources/primary-sources.json` for testing purposes.

# Usage

## Extracting primary sources

Use `extract_seed_primary_sources` in `primary_source.extract` function to extract all primary sources. This function will yield all the primary sources available in `primary_sources.json` source file.

## Transforming primary sources

1. Use `transform_seed_primary_sources_to_extracted_primary_sources` in `priamry_sources.transform` to get `ExtractedPrimarySource`. This function will yield all the primary sources, which is often not required.

2. So to filter out only the required x-system primary sources use `get_primary_sources_by_name` in `priamry_sources.transform`. This function needs Iterable from step-1 and names of the required x-systems. For example by passing names as `mex`, `ldap`, `confluence-vvt` will return `ExtractedPrimarySource` of these x-system.
