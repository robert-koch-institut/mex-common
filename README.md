## project

With the Metadata Exchange (MEx) project, the [RKI](https://www.rki.de) is developing a
transparency platform for finding metadata on the institute's research activities and
data.

MEx makes metadata findable, accessible, and shareable on a daily basis,
as well as available for further research. MEx enables users to get an overview of what
research data is available, understand its context, and know what needs to be considered
for subsequent use.

The platform is currently in internal use but will also be made publicly available
and thus be available to external researchers as well as the interested (professional)
public.

For further details, please consult the
[project page](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Forsch/MEx/MEx_node.html).

## package

The `mex-common` library is a software development toolkit that is used by multiple
components within the MEx project. It contains utilities for building pipelines
like a common commandline interface, logging and configuration setup. It also provides
common auxiliary connectors that can be used to fetch data from external services and
a re-usable implementation of the MEx metadata schema as pydantic models.

## license

This package is licensed under the [MIT license](/LICENSE). Other components of the
MEx project will be released under the same license in the future.
