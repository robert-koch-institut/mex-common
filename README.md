## project

The Metadata Exchange (MEx) project is committed to improve the retrieval of RKI
research data and projects. How? By focusing on metadata: instead of providing the
actual research data directly, the MEx metadata catalog captures descriptive information
about research data and activities. On this basis, we want to make the data FAIR[^1] so
that it can be shared with others.

Via MEx, metadata will be made findable, accessible and shareable, as well as available
for further research. The goal is to get an overview of what research data is available,
understand its context, and know what needs to be considered for subsequent use.

After an internal launch, the metadata will also be made publicly available and thus be
available to external researchers as well as the interested (professional) public to
find research data from the RKI.

For further details, please consult our
[project page](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Forsch/MEx/MEx_node.html).

[^1]: FAIR is referencing the so-called
[FAIR data principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) â€“ guidelines to make
data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable.

## package

The `mex-common` library is a software development toolkit that is used by multiple
components within the MEx project. It contains utilities for building pipelines
like a common commandline interface, logging and configuration setup. It also provides
common auxiliary connectors that can be used to fetch data from external services and
a re-usable implementation of the MEx metadata schema as pydantic models.

## license

This package is licensed under the [MIT license](/LICENSE). Other components of the
MEx project will be released under the same license in the future.

## development

### installation

- on unix, consider using pyenv https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv

  - run `make install`
- on windows, see https://python-poetry.org/docs/managing-environments
  - install `python3.11` in your preferred way
  - go to repo root
  - run `.\mex.bat install`

### linting and testing

- on unix run `make test`
- on windows run `.\mex.bat test`
- or run manually
  - linter checks via `pre-commit run --all-files`
  - all tests via `poetry run pytest`

### updating dependencies

- update global dependencies in `requirements.txt` manually
- update git hooks with `pre-commit autoupdate`
- show outdated dependencies with `poetry show --outdated`
